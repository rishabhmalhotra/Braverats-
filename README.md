# Braverats-
Braverats is a popular game.
It goes something like this:

In BraveRats, each player has eight cards numbered zero through seven.

A round consists of each player secretly selecting a card, and then the cards are revealed simultaneously. 
One of the players may win that round, or the round may be “on hold” to be resolved in a later round. A game of BraveRats is played over multiple rounds, but in this assignment we are only interested in one round.
In general, the card with the highest value wins the round, but many of the cards have special powers when played. For example, a princess (one) can beat the prince (seven). The assassin (three) changes the rules so the lowest value wins the round. However, the assassin does not work against the prince, and the assassin can be thwarted by the wizard (five) who cancels out the opponent’s special powers.
If you are curious, the full rules of the BraveRats are available at https://www.student. cs.uwaterloo.ca/ ̃cs135/assns/BraveRats.pdf and you can also visit the BraveRats page at BoardGameGeek: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/ 112373/braverats.
You can play BraveRats with 16 cards from a regular deck of cards.

This is what my code does:

Takes in 2 inputs (one for each user; assuming that 2 people are playing the game) and shows the winner of the battle
